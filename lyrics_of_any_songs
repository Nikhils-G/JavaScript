To generate lyrics for any song programmatically, you can use Python and a natural language processing model like GPT-3 or similar models. Below is a simplified example of how to create a Python script for generating song-like lyrics using the `openai` library (assuming you have API access):

```python
import openai

# Replace with your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

def generate_lyrics(prompt, max_length=150):
    """
    Generate song lyrics based on a prompt.
    
    :param prompt: The starting prompt for the song.
    :param max_length: Maximum number of tokens for the lyrics.
    :return: Generated song lyrics as a string.
    """
    try:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use other models like gpt-3.5-turbo
            prompt=f"Write a song with the theme: {prompt}. Make it poetic and rhythmic.",
            max_tokens=max_length,
            temperature=0.7,  # Controls creativity
            n=1,
            stop=None  # Stops generation only when it reaches the token limit
        )
        return response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error generating lyrics: {e}"

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    theme = input("Enter a theme for the song: ")
    lyrics = generate_lyrics(theme)
    print("\nGenerated Song Lyrics:\n")
    print(lyrics)
```

### How to Use:
1. Install the OpenAI Python library if you haven’t already:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```
2. Replace `"your-api-key"` with your OpenAI API key.
3. Run the script and input the desired theme or starting line for the song.

### Output Example:
For a theme like "lost in the stars," the output could look like this:

```
Generated Song Lyrics:

Verse 1:
Lost in the stars, I’m adrift tonight,  
Guided by dreams, under silver light.  
The heavens whisper, a soft refrain,  
Carried by winds, through the midnight's pain.  

Chorus:  
Oh, the galaxies call, their voices so near,  
Through infinite skies, they erase my fear.  
In the arms of the cosmos, I’ll find where I belong,  
Lost in the stars, in the melody’s song.  
```
